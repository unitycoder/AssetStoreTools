# :warning: This repo has been Deprecated

Because lastest official [Asset Store Tools](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/unity/asset-store-tools-115) has been greatly improved since version 5.0.4, many of the annoying issues have been fixed. Please use the offical Asset Store Tools instead.

# AssetStoreTools
An improved version of [the offical Unity3D asset store tools](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/unity/asset-store-tools-115).

The latest release is compatible with Unity 5.6.6, 2017.3, 2017.4, 2018.3, 2018.4, 2019.1, 2019.2, 2019.3 and 2020.1.

# Usage

See [releases](https://github.com/zwcloud/AssetStoreTools/releases).

# Improvement

* the file Selector can add / remove every folder separately (by JeReT)
* two buttons to expand / collapse all folders (by JeReT)
    ![gif animation illustrating the improvement](Doc/Img/improvement.gif)
* Complete uploading when first progress bar reaches 100%. So Unity no longer crashes/freezes after that.
* Don't close the window after finished uploading the package, so we can upload another package without being interrupted.
